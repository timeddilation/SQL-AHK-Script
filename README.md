# SQL-AHK-Script
An AHK script to assist writing SQL

This AHK scipt is for the lazy, who want don't want to hold the shift key, or don't want to use caps lock, but still want nice looking SQL.

The short scipt includes thing I find personally useful, such as '8' => '*' because I use the shift key so infrequently, I fail to even type 'SELECT *'.

Additionally, you can make your own keywords, such as I have. Or if you have that stupid long table name you're tired of typing everytime, you can make your own keyword.
Such as:
'''
::drfgs::DepartmentResearchFilterGraphs
'''

I can't even begin to explain how annoying that table name is. So please, feel free to modify this and use it as your own.
